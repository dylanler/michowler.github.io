  <h2>How I started to code?</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Hi everyone, I'm a 20 y.o who loves coding ever since my brother introduced me to a new language called Ruby! It wasn't a great experience at first because everything seemed so dull and it didn't capture my full attention, so I slept on it. Regardless, the curiousity about coding still lingered in me, and I finally decided to take it seriously by pushing my own limits, studying how to code through Codecademy during my A-level days. However, progress was REAL SLOW. Without further delay, after A-levels, I entered a full stack Web Development Bootcamp at NEXT Academy and realized my passion towards the whole tech industry. Everthing I did and done was a great satisfication which makes me want to step further and deeper into it. Never once was I bored to do it, unlike the many things I ended up quitting, this was different. I wanted to do well and I was always eager to learn about it, from anyone and anywhere! I joined many tech events(Techladies, WWCode, RailsGirls, Google events, etc) as I really love indulging in the moment where so many like minded people gather and talk about their ideas. I have a long way to go, to gain experience and connections, so hire me today! </p>
